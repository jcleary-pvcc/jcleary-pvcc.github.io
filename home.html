<h2>“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic….” 
-The United States Oath of Allegiance, which all appointed to public office, save for the president, must swear to.  [Cornell] </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
Every portion of the United States government is focused on the maintenance of the country, the land it occupies, and the people within. 
And to aid in this, there are specialized departments and bureaus focused on certain tasks. 
For example, the EPA centers on the protection of the environment, the Department of Defense works alongside, and is a part of, the military, and the Bureau of Land Management explains itself.

Following this, the Department of Homeland Security has a role to serve as well. 
To quote the official website of the DHS, their role is to “secure the nation against any threats we may face.”
Founded in 2002 [DHS], the DHS is effectively a conglomerate of various pre-existing agencies, notable among them being Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
In short, keeping with the Oath of Allegiance, the Department of Homeland Security focuses on the “domestic” part which requires protection, ensuring any threats to the U.S inside our borders, 
be it natural disasters or cyberattacks, are eliminated or reduced in severity.

<h3> Founding </h3>
The Department of Homeland Security was founded in March 2003, with its charter act signed into law by then President George W. Bush in 2002. 
This was in response to the September 11th attacks, in order to help prevent such an attack from happening again. 

<h3> Sub-Agencies </h3>
As mentioned prior, the DHS comprises many countless sub-agencies, which are each specialized in a specialized goal.
This Official Public Organization Chart put out by the DHS lays out exactly what agencies are under the DHS’ umbrella.

Some of the roles of these agencies are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>FEMA Provides relief during emergencies, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.</li>
            <li>ICE Ensures border laws and customs are enforced</li>
            <li>Citizenship and Immigration Services manages immigration and naturalization processes</li>
			<li>And the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) Is primarily responsible for securing air traffic.</li>
        </ul>
<h3> How the DHS impacts your daily life </h3>
As with many government functions, one must ask, “How does this impact my life?” The answer is entirely depending on what they do. 
For example, those who have immigrated, or are related/connected to an immigrant would know about Immigration services, and possibly ICE. 
In the case of a disaster, such as a hurricane, or a flash flood, FEMA is the one which sets up the tents and provides relief to those affected. 
Those who work at sea or in other parts of the maritime sector are familiar with the Coast Guard, who assist should something either be a threat, or go awry when at sea.

Those who work in computer science should know about the existence of Cybersecurity, and should be taking steps to secure their systems. 
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the charge in this regard, especially with President Biden’s emphasis on cybersecurity [DHS: cybersecurity].	

<h3> Conclusion </h3>
Being focused, as is its name, on security, the DHS ensures that the American populace remains safe, against all threats, foreign or domestic. 
Whether it be protecting maritime workers from sea-borne threats via the coast guard, ensuring the air traffic of the USA runs smoothly and safely through the TSA, 
or granting relief to the survivors of a natural disaster through FEMA, the DHS serves as critical role in American society.
